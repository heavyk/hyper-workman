# hyper-workman

a super cool keyboard configuration inspired by [Enhanced CapsLock](https://github.com/Vonng/Capslock) and then tailored for the [Workman Keyboard Layout](https://workmanlayout.org/).

Caps-Lock = HYPER
Caps-Lock + Shift = HYPER+Shift

the text buffer can be navigated using the <kbd>U</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> right-hand keys. then, almost every movement can also turn into a select operation by pressing <kbd>tab</kbd> at the same time, as if it were the <kbd>shift</kbd>.

---

this is my first keyboard configuration and I'm learning a lot. there are quite a few inefficiencies still, while I'm learning about it. eventually, I want to end up with an intelligent text editor with efficient key-bindings built for the workman layout.
